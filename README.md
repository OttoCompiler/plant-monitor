# Plant Monitoring System



The Plant Monitoring System is a lightweight, end-to-end software tool designed to track the health of indoor or outdoor plants in real time. 

Software provided as-is and works as a single file. I accept no liability for the use or misuse of this software.

Run with `python3 plant_mon.py`
